We check if there is anything from flag00 with find cmd
-- find / -user flag00 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied" 

On remarque un fichier qui semble etre le retour d'une utilisation de john ( logiciel pour cracker des mots de passe )

It seems like an output of john, a tool to crack password.
The output seems to be encrypt, after some research it seems like an data shift cipher.
With a website we can easily find out the answer 
-- cat /usr/sbin/john
-> cdiiddwpgswtgt

With dcode.fr we find out the answer is nottoohardhere
let's try it as password for flag00
-- su flag 00

It works now we can execute getflag
