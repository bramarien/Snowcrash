When we execute this one it show use that we need our Uid to be 4242.
The executable have the suid enabled.

Let's analyze the executable
- ltrace ./level13

The executable use the getuid funtion and we see it return 2013.
A simple way is to reverse this.

- gdb ./level13
- b main
- layout asm ( or disass main )
( check address of return instruction and break to this )
- b *0xXXXXXX
( check value eax )
- p %eax
( we should see 2013 )
and we can just change the value by 4242
- set $eax=4242
- and we continue to the end of the executable

Our flag should be printed
