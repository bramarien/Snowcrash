We have a php file which we can read let's take a look.
It's a PHP script who use file_get_contents() and preg_replace().

With some search we know that preg_replace() is been deprecated for one reason.

When using /e with preg_replace it force the function to use Eval when applying the replacement.
In function x() there is a call to replace with '/e'

Now we just have to make a call with system or exec function with a good syntax to be able to bypass the regex and allow replace to call our own function.

The regex is "/(\[x (.*)\)/e" it means our string we have to contain [x ] to be used by the regex. Then we can try [x system(whoami)] to see if it work

The script return system(whoami). Well it didnt work
The problem here is because we need to evaluate our call to system will the function is reading it.

we can try using variable evaluation : [x ${system(whoami)}}]
this time the script return an error and said he failed evaluating our code.
Its because ${var} is only used to evaluate variable and not function.
To be able to do so we will need a complex (curly) syntax like this : {${func()}}

the difference here is we evaluate the return of the system function instead of the function itself.

Let's finally try with: [x {${system(whoami)}}]

Between some warning the script should have return flag06 which means we should be allowed to run getflag:  [x {${system(getflag)}}]
