Here we have again a token file and an executable.
The token file is readable and it seems encrypted.

The executable seems to take a string in input and print it encrypted
we can do some test with it like 
-./level09 1234
-./level09 test
-./level09 cooooool
-./level09 00000000

The encryption seems to add the value of the index to the caracter at the same index
we can try to reverse it with a short c program.
take a look at exploit.c

-scp -P 4242 level09/exploit.c level09@192.168.1.57:/tmp

Let's compile it and use it with the token file

-cd /tmp
-gcc exploit.c
-./a.out `cat /home/user/level09/token`

and it return the token decrypted by our function.

-su flag09
-f3iji1ju5yuevaus41q1afiuq


-getflag
