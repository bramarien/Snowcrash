We can see there is a CGI script running and on the script the suid is set and it's making a call to echo.

Linux automatically block script with setuid to prevent hack.
With some parameters the server can still run the script as flag04. We can check if their is these config in server files.
We use ps -ef to check what is running and we can see an apache2 server is running so lets go in thes file ( located at /etc/apache2 )

in sites-enabled we have a list of active server, let's cat level05.conf
Suexec is declared which mean that the server is able to use script as flag04 even if the call is made from level04.

So let's try :)

curl 'localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=$(whoami)'

It should return flag04. It means we can launch getflag and it should return our code
