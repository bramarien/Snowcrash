The token file can only be read by flag10.
level10 executable as Suid set and its owner is flag10.
let's analyze what the executable do

when we try to use the executable with a file that we can read it show use that it try to connect on an given IP under 6969 port.

Let's try to listen on this port and send 127.0.0.1 as ip to the executable

On reception it print the content of the file.

let's check what is inside the executable to seek for a potential exploit.
-- ltrace ./level10 /tmp/test 127.0.0.1

We can see the program use access to check if we have the priviliege to read this file.
Then it open and read the file befor printing it to the listener.

We can use the exploit TOCTTOU ( time of check to time of update )


Let's copy our c program to help us in this task.
-- scp -P 4242 TOCTTOU.c level10@192.168.1.57:/tmp


Compile it, listen to multiple connection on 6969 port
( Ignore some caractere to make it more readable )
-- cd /tmp ; gcc TOCTTOU.c
-- nc -lk 6969 | grep -v ".*( )*."
 
and then execute our programm

The flag should appear on the listener



flag10 -> woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

level11 -> feulo4b72j7edeahuete3no7c
