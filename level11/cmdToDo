The Lua script can be open let's read what's inside.
Again the Suid is set under flag11
it create a server under 5151 port
Request a password who get hashed and tested to check if we have the good PW

The hash function use io.popen which execute command in a subprocess
Here the command use echo with our argument.

Let's just do some code injection and use getflag to be able to execute it under flag11 priviliege.

First we connect to the server
-- nc 127.0.0.1 5151
and then we prompt our command
-- $(getflag) > /tmp/flg
-- cat /tmp/flg

And there is our token.
