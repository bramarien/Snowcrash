We have an executable who return our username with the Suid enabled.
if we use ltrace on the executable we can see it use getenv("LOGNAME") followed by a call to system which use the return of getenv.

Let's try to edit the LOGNAME env variable to see if the executable use this Var

LOGNAME="test"

The exec should return test. Next thing we know, it's possible to insert a cmd to the executable using the env like this:
 LOGNAME=";whoami"

Because the executable use echo he interprete the variable and use it like this 
echo ; whoami
In shell ; is used to executable a different command next to another.

Let's try to run it with getflag this time

LOGNAME=";getflag"
