Here we have an executable with the suid activ from flag08 and a file called token who can only be read by flag08.
if we use the command file on level08 we can read it uses shared libs ( dynamically linked )
So with nm cmd we can see all symbols from this executable ( or use ltrace to see a library call tracer )
-> nm ./level08 token
-> ltrace ./level08 token

In the main function, the file is open and being read.
Then the string agrument pass to level08 is compared to the string "token".
if the name is different from token the file will be printed. Otherwise it print "You may not access"
So if we managed to call the executable with token file as an argument with an other name it should work and print what is inside.

there is an exploit were we can put a symlink to the token file with a different name and the read permission enabled
if we managed to pass the symlink to level08 it should open and read the token file by the symlink then compare the name of the symlink with "token" string.
Let's try it.

-cd /tmp; ln -s /home/user/level08/token flag;
-cd; ./level08 /tmp/flag

and we get quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean which is the password for user flag08

-su flag08
quif5eloekouj29ke0vouxean

- getflag

flag -> 25749xKZ8L7DkSCwJkT9dyv6f
